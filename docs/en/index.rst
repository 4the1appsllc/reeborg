   This is a model of Reeborg made by a student in New Jersey (USA) who
   learned Python with RUR-PLE, an older version of Reeborg's World
   that has been available as a desktop program since 2004.

Reeborg's World is an adaptation of Richard Pattis's *Karel the robot*.
It supports three programming languages (Python, Javascript and CoffeeScript).
However, the focus of this documentation is on Python which is my
favourite programming language and, I believe,
the ideal one to use for teaching programming concepts.  Unless otherwise
noted, this documentation refers to the Python version.


Reeborg's World is **free**: *free* to use, *free* to copy (and put on a school's
website), and does not require any registration or login.
Unlike some other existing code learning website, it does not force
learners to follow a pre-defined path; teachers are *free* to create their
own learning material and make use of Reeborg's World.

Task Driven Learning
--------------------

Reeborg's World is designed for *Task Driven Learning*: students are given
tasks that Reeborg has to complete, and they must write programs instructing
Reeborg how to do so.

Tasks include having Reeborg move objects, build walls, or go to a
particular location.  Objects in Reeborg's World are colourful; the
places they be must moved to by Reeborg are indicated by having a
picture of the object in shades of grey.
