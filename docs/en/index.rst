Reeborg's World is an adaptation of Richard Pattis's *Karel the robot*.
It supports three programming languages (Python, Javascript and CoffeeScript) although
the focus is on Python which is my favourite programming language and, I believe,
the ideal one to use for teaching programming concepts.  Unless otherwise
noted, this documentation refers to the Python version.
