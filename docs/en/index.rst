Welcome to Reeborg's World's documentation!

   This is a model of Reeborg made by a student in New Jersey (USA) who
   learned Python with RUR-PLE, an older version of Reeborg's World
   that has been available as a desktop program since 2004.

Reeborg's World is an adaptation of Richard Pattis's *Karel the robot*.
It supports three programming languages (Python, Javascript and CoffeeScript).
However, the focus of this documentation is on Python which is my
favourite programming language and, I believe,
the ideal one to use for teaching programming concepts.  Unless otherwise
noted, this documentation refers to the Python version.


Reeborg's World is free: free to use, free to copy (and put on a school's
website), and does not require any registration or login.
