Objects, background images, etc.
================================

Reeborg can interact with various objects.  He can ``take()``
and ``put()`` down the following such objects, in particular,
|token| **token**, Reeborg's favourite object.  Tokens are like coins, except
most people find them of little value, especially with the smiling face
image; Reeborg begs to differ.

If there are more than one
object present, and Reeborg needs to specify which object to ``take()`` or
``put()`` down, Reeborg uses the name of the object as a string of character,
as in ``put("token")``  or ``take('token')``  [both single and double quotes
can be used, as long as they occur in pairs.]

In addition to tokens, Reeborg can interact with various geometrical
shapes, fruits, flowers, vegetables, etc.  [Many of these images
